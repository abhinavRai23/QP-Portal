### Modal Question paper portal for AKTU

With this portal, different teachers can add questions and their respective answers one by one. We have used a rich text editor to easily add or modify questions and their answers. Teachers can add questions and their types. 
Then we have an upper authority who can create multiple question papers by choosing different questions and create a complete question paper. They can even take a preview or download pdf of these question papers.
There is one more level with is super admin. As the name suggests super admin will have permission to look into any subject and can perform any CRUD operation.
The last one is students, they can check final published versions of Modal question papers and practice before exam existing or any newer pattern proposed.
